            I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student with a
            deep passion for programming. My curiosity and drive to explore the
            tech world led me to dive into full-stack development, where I honed
            my skills in the Full stack development (MongoDB, Express.js, React,
            Node.js, Typescript, MySQL, PostgreSQL). In addition to web
            development, I am highly interested in competitive programming,
            where I focus on sharpening my problem-solving abilities.

            I continuously work on improving my understanding of Data Structures
            and Algorithms (DSA), which helps me tackle challenges in both
            development and algorithmic thinking. Whether itâ€™s building
            efficient applications or solving complex coding problems, I am
            always eager to learn and grow in the world of tech.
